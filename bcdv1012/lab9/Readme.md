- Either use Web3 or Ethers to grab the past transactions of a specific address. The address can be hardcoded. 
- Example address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4b9663aa59642a9c3a8bca87542abbf9462b213
- Create an action to fetch all the past transaction
- Create a reducer to store the past transaction response in the Redux store
- Connect your component to the store  and display all of them in a list
- Each item in a list should contain from(Address), to(address), and the value in Ether unit.  


### Hint:  
    [Get transaction history](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/cookbook-accounts.html#get-transaction-history)  
    Use [utils.formatUnits](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/api-utils.html) to format the value from wei to ether.
